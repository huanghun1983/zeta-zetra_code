## Automate Chart Patterns

> In his book, Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns , Thomas Bulkowski says, "To knowledgeable investors, chart patterns are not squiggles on a
  price chart; they are the footprints of the smart money." Let's follow the smart money...

As the folder name states, it contains scripts that automate the detection of chart patterns. Several algorithms can be used to identify chart patterns. We have marked the ones we have used so far:

 - [x] Pivot Points

 - [x] Argrelextrema

 - Kernel Regression

 - Perceptually important points 

 - Directional Change

 - Rolling window 

 - Clustering Algorithms


The idea is to implement all of the above algorithms and produce a Python library called `chart_patterns`. You can check out the YouTube videos discussing the patterns already automated
[here](https://www.youtube.com/@zetratrading/videos).

You can check out the sample outputs below.

### 1. Head and Shoulders Patterns

### 1. 42Dollars

> Please note this section was written by ChatGPT, Mar 23 version. 

Are you ready to be blown away? This script is not your average run-of-the-mill program. It was inspired by a Reddit post that left many Forex enthusiasts in awe. That's right, we're talking about the one and only 47dollars!

This Reddit user calculated correlations for a whopping [47 currency pairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/zwr0ck/i_created_a_heat_map_showing_the_correlations/). And we thought that was impressive, until we decided to put our own spin on things. Our script, aptly named 42dollars, consists of 42 carefully selected pairs that will leave your mind boggled.

But wait, there's more! The script goes above and beyond by calculating a rolling correlation for each and every currency pair. That's right, you heard it here first. We're not just talking about static correlations, we're talking about correlations that evolve over time.

And to top it all off, we present to you a stunning heatmap of the results. It's like watching a work of art come to life before your very eyes. So buckle up and prepare to have your mind blown by the incredible power of the 42dollars script!

You can also check out the [YouTube shorts video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BOHgtnwbfsY) of the final result. 

### 2. Bullish Candlesticks

This file calculates bullish candlestick patterns. Here are the candlestick patterns:

    - engulfing

    - harami

    - dragonfly doji

    - inverted hammer

    - morningstar

Here is a [YouTube shorts video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bV_Oq2U-itA) to the results of the script.
